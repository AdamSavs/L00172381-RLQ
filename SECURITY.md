# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This section outlines which versions of our project are actively supported with security updates. Older versions may not receive timely patches or security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Version Support Lifecycle:
Major Versions: Each major version (e.g., 5.x, 4.x) is supported for a minimum of 12 months after its release. During this period, critical and high-severity vulnerabilities will be patched.
End-of-Life (EOL): Once a version reaches its end-of-life, it will no longer receive any security updates, and users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a supported version.
Security Patches: Security patches for supported versions will be released in accordance with the severity of the discovered vulnerability. Patches are typically made available within 1–2 weeks of discovery for high and critical vulnerabilities.
For guidance on upgrading to a supported version, please refer to the Upgrade Guide.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you have discovered a security vulnerability or potential risk in our project, we ask that you report it promptly to help protect our users.

## How to Report:
Email: Send a detailed report to [security@example.com] or use our designated vulnerability report form on our website.
Information to Include: Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
The version of the software in which the vulnerability was found.
Steps to reproduce the issue, including code or configurations.
Any other relevant data that will help us assess and address the issue.
Proof of concept (if possible).

## Response Time:
We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days.
You can expect an update within 1–2 weeks after the initial acknowledgment. In cases of complex vulnerabilities, additional time may be required for investigation and patch development.

## What to Expect:
Accepted Vulnerabilities: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to release a security patch as quickly as possible and notify all users of the update. The vulnerability will also be documented in our public security advisories.

Declined Vulnerabilities: If the vulnerability does not meet the criteria for a security fix (e.g., it’s not deemed a security risk or cannot be reproduced), you will receive an explanation from our security team.

Acknowledgment: If you reported a vulnerability, you will be credited for the discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous).

## Confidentiality:
We ask that any discovered vulnerabilities not be disclosed publicly until a patch has been released. This is to ensure the security of our users and prevent exploitation of the vulnerability before a fix is available.
